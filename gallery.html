              "As we introduce our journey to Bogotá we discorvered unforgettable place. The city, with its lively
              streets, colorful
              buildings, and vibrant urban atmosphere, may seem daunting to first-time visitors. However, once you let
              yourself be immersed in the energy of the city, there is so much to discover.

              Our first trip was for paying tribute to the spirits. At Cristo Rey, we had the opportunity to participate
              in an indigenous ceremony to bless
              our travels. It was a beautiful and unforgettable experience, and we felt so grateful to be able to
              witness and be part of this special moment.

              However, it is important to note that the journey to Cristo Rey was not without its challenges. As we
              ascended the hill, we experienced physical difficulties due to the lack of oxygen at higher altitudes. The
              travel fatigue made it even more difficult, but we were determined to reach the top and see the stunning
              panoramic view of Bogotá.

              When we finally arrived at the top, the view was breathtaking. We were able to admire the city below and
              take unforgettable photos. The statue of Cristo Rey itself was impressive, with its right arm raised to
              the sky. It has become an important symbol of the city and the Catholic faith. We also visited the small
              chapel located below the statue, which was a peaceful and spiritual experience.

              Overall, a visit to Bogotá is a unique experience, and a visit to Cristo Rey on the heights of the city is
              an unforgettable moment that deserves to be lived. Although it can be physically challenging, the
              breathtaking view and the cultural significance of the statue and the indigenous ceremony make it well
              worth the effort."

              Upon our arrival, we were taken on a city walk to explore the various artistic movements that make up the
              streets of Bogota. The city is full of colourful and lively street art that often reflects the pain and
              stress experienced by Colombian citizens. These works of art have strong political connections and provide
              commentary on the Colombian government's actions, referencing the injustice experienced by indigenous and
              Afro-Colombian communities. They also address more recent events, such as the 2016 social war regarding
              armed conflict in Colombia and the excessive use of firearms by police and military personnel.

              During the city walk, we visited a cafe that supports freedom of speech and serves as an art house where
              individuals can create art and express their messages. This cafe provides a safe space for people to enjoy
              food, music, art, and the company of like-minded individuals. Here, we engaged in conversations with
              several representatives of groups fighting for action in Colombia. This experience was just the beginning
              of the many stories, pains, understandings, and respects we would gain throughout our journey.

              In this context, we were introduced to the PCN, an organization that fights for the rights of
              Afro-Colombians. While one can read about such experiences from afar, encountering the individuals who
              have lived through these events face-to-face transforms the experience completely. The leaders and
              members of PCN are highly inspiring, and their passion and drive for change are contagious. During our
              visit to PCN headquarters, they explained their history, development, and key principles related to
              their rights to their identity, territory, and culture. These principles include identifying as
              Afro-Colombian due to structural racism, the right to organize, the need for space, and solidarity with
              other communities. Our visit to a region of Bogota, which was the product of several communities'
              displacement in Colombia, provided us with first-hand insight into the immense damage displacement has
              on these populations. We met leaders who had also experienced displacement and violence from
              paramilitary groups. It was an emotional experience for all of us, seeing houses with no basic
              amenities, and meeting people who had lost everything. The concept of government or paramilitary groups
              being the root of this is difficult to comprehend when coming from different political structures.
              However, the warmth, hospitality, and kindness of these communities were immeasurable, despite the
              undeniable frustration and sadness. This visit further educated us on the several acts of discrimination
              and violence experienced by indigenous and Afro-Colombian groups, where we learned about the long line
              of struggle caused by displacement. These communities not only lose their homes and areas of residence
              but also their cultural and religious practices, and their freedom is stripped away.

              On this particular day, we were presented with an exceptional opportunity to connect with the
              Afrocolombian community and gain invaluable insight into their perspectives on various experiences that
              have impacted their community. These experiences included the pervasive issue of violence and the critical
              implementation of the ethnic chapter of the peace treaty.

              Through this experience, we found ourselves deeply enriched by the knowledge and understanding we gained.
              We were able to learn more about the challenges that the Afrocolombian community was facing, as well as
              the objectives that they were striving to achieve in their journey towards peaceful integration and
              cohabitation.

              As we spent more time with the community, we were struck by their resilience, determination, and
              unwavering commitment to their cause. We were inspired by their passion and dedication, and we felt
              privileged to have had the opportunity to learn from them.

              Towards the end of the day, we gathered with other groups to discuss our collective journey and present
              our findings to key members of the community. This was an incredible opportunity to share our insights,
              discuss our observations, and engage in meaningful dialogue with individuals who were equally committed to
              the cause of peaceful coexistence.

              Overall, this experience left an indelible impression on us. It reinforced our understanding of the
              importance of active engagement with communities who are striving to achieve a better tomorrow, and it
              reminded us of the transformative power of cross-cultural exchange and collaboration.
